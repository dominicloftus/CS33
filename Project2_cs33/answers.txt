1.) The problem was caused by the instruction
48 8d 04 ad 02 00 00 00 lea 0x2(,%rbp,4),%rax
which caused overflow in the return value

2.) It is coded into the header file that it recieves its data from

3.) The way that emacs multiplies the numbers using masks creates an overflow
to 1

4.) Emacs would probably face problems when people are expecting a certain
answer and recieve incorrect information for what they needed. As opposed to
not using it when the user will recieve warning messages regarding overflow
