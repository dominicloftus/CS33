I'll refer to compilation with flag -O2 as 1
compilation with flags -O2 -fwrapv as 2
and compilation with flags -O2 -fsanitize=undefined as 3

Compilations 1 and 3 ended up with the same assembly code that always returned false,
but I believe for different reasons. 1 was because the compiler logically
understands that adding any positive value will always be greater then
