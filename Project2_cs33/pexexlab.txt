First I opened into gdb with the emacs executable file using
$gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-26.1
which opened the gdb window

Then I set a breakpoint at function Ftimes by using
(gdb) b Ftimes
which set the breakpoint

Then I ran the function using command
(gdb) run -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
which began running through the function until it hit the breakpoint at Ftimes

I than used command
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on
which which broke down each line of source code into assembly and machine code

I began tracing through the program using
(gdb) si
after each command I would copy down the machine address, machine, and assembly code
down into the trace

Then I would use
(gdb) info reg
to get values stored at register affected by the program running and copy
it into the trace
